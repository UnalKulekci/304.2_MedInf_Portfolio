    "text": "Device Setup and Findings\nDuring the week, the ECG device required to carry out the project was procured. After receiving the device, I tested it on myself to examine how it worked and how it recorded data. I also read the device’s user manual and verbally shared the information that we could only retrieve data from the device in PDF and SCP formats with my other team members during a meeting. Subsequently, my team members in the Capteur team obtained the technical documentation for the device by contacting the CTO.\nUser Manual Link: D-Heart User Manual\nDuring the process of extracting data from the device, my colleague, who is a Data Scientist, discovered that we could connect to the device via Bluetooth using the bleak Python library. At this point, I thoroughly reviewed the technical documentation (D-HEART Bluetooth LE Protocol Description) and analyzed the format in which the data was transmitted via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).\n\n\n\nExample of Data Extracted from Device\n\n\nBased on the technical data at hand and the basic connection structure created by my colleague, I prepared a comprehensive script with LLM support. By running this script, I successfully transferred the raw data to the Python environment; this work allowed us to exceed the 60-second recording limit specified in the user guide, significantly increasing our data depth for future analyses. Although this task was not directly part of my job description, I chose to engage in this technical process to better understand the analysis process and save time.",

During my research, I found a PDF copy of the book titled “ECG Signal Processing, Classification and Interpretation” published by Springer and started reading it. You can access the notes I took during my reading and later shared with my team members here: Typst Project In addition to all this, I reviewed the device’s user manual and shared its features for recording ECG signals with my team members via the Discord channel we use for communication.\n\n\n\nECG Device Characteristics\n\n\n\n\nClient Presentation & Clinical Insights\nMy colleague Loïc and I worked on the section about us for the presentation to the client. Based on my experience as a healthcare professional in my previous career and my current research, I shared with him the clinical information on what diagnoses can be obtained by analyzing ECG signals. We synthesized this technical and medical information and added it to the client presentation.",

    "text": "What skills does this demonstrate?\nThe activities I completed this week match the following engineering competencies:\n\nData & Computer Science Engineering Competencies\n\nTechnical Proficiency: I analyzed the device’s technical protocol (D-HEART BLE Protocol). Using an LLM, I developed a Python script to extract raw data from the device.\nToolchain Utilization: I used Quarto and Typst for my portfolio and documentation. This helped me connect my code with my written reports effectively.\nResearch & Critical Thinking: I analyzed the user manual and found some limits, such as the 60-second recording limit. I designed a technical solution (using BLE raw data) to bypass these limits.\n\n\n\nProfessional Skills (Soft Skills)\n\nClinical Insight Integration: I used my past experience as a healthcare professional to analyze ECG signals. Together with my teammate Loïc, we added medical details to the client presentation.\nCollaboration & Support: My teammate (Data Scientist) found the bleak library. I improved his code to analyze the data format and helped the team access the data more easily.\nComprehension: I attended the kick-off meeting with the CEO and CTO. I analyzed the project goals, team roles, and delivery requirements.\n\nMethodology: I joined the Jira system created by Olivier. By registering for the team, I became part of the project management and workflow",
