After receiving the device, I tested it on myself to examine how it worked and how it recorded data.\nI also read the device’s user manual and verbally shared the information that we could only retrieve data from the device in PDF and SCP formats with my other team members during a meeting. Subsequently, my team members in the Capteur team obtained the technical documentation for the device by contacting the CTO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUseful Resource\n\n\n\nD-Heart User Manual — Contains electrode placement instructions, recording limits, and supported export formats (PDF, SCP).\n\n\nDuring the process of extracting data from the device, my colleague, who is a Data Scientist, discovered that we could connect to the device via Bluetooth using the bleak Python library. At this point, I thoroughly reviewed the technical documentation (D-HEART Bluetooth LE Protocol Description) and analyzed the format in which the data was transmitted via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Raw BLE data successfully extracted from the ECG device into Python\n\n\n\nBased on the technical data at hand and the basic connection structure created by my colleague, I prepared a comprehensive script with LLM support. By running this script, I successfully transferred the raw data to the Python environment; this work allowed us to exceed the 60-second recording limit specified in the user guide, significantly increasing our data depth for future analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKey Achievement\n\n\n\nAlthough this task was not directly part of my job description, I chose to engage in this technical process to better understand the analysis process and save time.",

Based on my experience as a healthcare professional in my previous career and my current research, I shared with him the clinical information on what diagnoses can be obtained by analyzing ECG signals. We synthesized this technical and medical information and added it to the client presentation.",

Improved his code to analyze the data format and helped the team access the data more easily.\n\n\nComprehension\nAttended the kick-off meeting with the CEO and CTO.

Also, seeing the 60-second limit in the manual gave us the idea to look for a better way like the BLE script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhy did you deal with technical documents and script writing even though it wasn’t part of your job description?\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to understand where the data comes from and how it is created for my future analysis.
